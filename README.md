# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Step 1: Install Vite

npm create vite@latest

# Step 2: Project structure:

Delete content on index.css
Delete components in App.jsx
Delete App.css and its ref
Add dirs: Components (with index.jsx), pages, utils (common functions), services (backend API), templates
Add fontawesome CDN (in index.html)

# Step 3: React router dom: npm i react-router-dom

Add routes folder
useRoutes hook

# Step 4: Tailwind CSS
